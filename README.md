# Weather Forecasting with Neural Networks

Current weather forecasts rely mainly on physical simulation and our knowledge of meteorological events (Science Daily). After collecting a variety data from observation, both historical and present, meteorologists feed the data into a model. This model is created from past data using statistical analysis. From this model, a forecast is produced. Another approach that has not yet been fully explored is that of using a convolutional neural network. The goal of this project is not to create a new model, but to show that weather forecasting can also be accomplished with a convolutional neural network. 

### Prerequisites

The programs are written in Python 3. 

### Installing

Much of the project runs on PyTorch, a Python package. To begin, pip install PyTorch.
```
pip install torch
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
